# dka-2-mka

Application transforms a deterministic FSM without unreachable states to a minimal 
FSM. It expects a valid deterministic FSM on its input. The input FSM is transformed
to a fully defined one if necessary and then minimalization is done using an algorithm
introduced in TIN, which is built on computation of k-indistinguishability.

The name of the state added during FSM completion (sink state) is chosen as the first
vacant number in the sequence 0, 1, 2, ... The merged states are always named after 
the smallest element in appropriate group (according to lexicographical order).

The application has been tested on a set of tests, which can be found in subfolder 'Tests'.
The set is also available at https://github.com/Bihanojko/dka-2-mka-tests.
